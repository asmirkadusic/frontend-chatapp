This file is part of frontend-chatapp project. This project is part of final project which I have for my homework in course Data Engineering and Distributed Information Systems. 

Application will have a few behaviors. 
First, application will have login and register form.
This part is currently in development stage and it will be done soon.

After I implement login and register forms, I will continue working on chat between two persons. This will be the main part of application. I didn't find out how I will implement this. I have a few ideas but I didn't decide yet. 

Also, application should have some kind of group chat. For this part it is same as a chat between just two persons.

This is main idea. So frontend will care out about client side part.

For this part I will use Ember.js framework. 

For building, installing and deploying I will update it during my progress.
